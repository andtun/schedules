### Repo for my research in the scheduling theory at ICS RAS.

Structure:

- Dual Alg - numeric experiments on the Dual Algorithm for the $1 | r_j | L_{max}$ scheduling problem
- Interpolation - research in a new approach to solving the scheduling theory problems using Lagrange and Chebyshev interpolation
- Surgery Scheduling - some files on the surgery scheduling problem being solved for the Burdenko neurosurgery institute
